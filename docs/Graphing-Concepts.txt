GRAPHING CONCEPTS
=================

In this section we will learn about..

Graphs:

+ How to model real world relationships 

+ one way direction 

+ node traversal 



Stateless Microservice:

+ Using timestamp-based throttling/backoff as your main concurrency control and loop prevention.

+ Using explicit parameters (like depth) passed in the crawl request to manage loops and limits.

+ Relying on data in the graph nodes themselves (e.g., LastScheduledAt, State) for decision-making.



Optimistic concurrency control (OCC):

+ strategy for managing concurrent access to data in distributed systems without using locks or state

+ concurency stratergies : skip / force / merge



Unit testing edge cases

+ Testing graph nodes
