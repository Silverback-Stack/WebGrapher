SETUP VS
========

We are using Visual Studio 2022

Make sure the following installation options selected

[to do]



Setup Self-signed certificate

To use https for development we need to create a self signed certificate for localhost.

Create a new folder: 

        c:\certs\

Open PowerShell as Administrator

Create a self-signed certificate for localhost (copy and paste this into shell)

        $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "localhost" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(1)

This creates a certificate in your local machine store and saves it in the variable $cert in the powershell window

From the same powershell window:

Export the cert + key to a PFX file

        $pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "1234" -Force -AsPlainText

        Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "C:\certs\localhost.pfx" -Password $pwd

Then Export the public certificate

        Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "C:\certs\localhost.cer"

Trust it

Double-click C:\certs\localhost.cer →
Install Certificate → Local Machine → Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Finish



VUE PROJECT 
===========

In the Vue project configure Vite to use HTTPS

In vite.config.js:

        import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
        import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
        import fs from 'fs'

        export default defineConfig({
          plugins: [vue()],
          server: {
            https: {
              pfx: fs.readFileSync('C:/certs/localhost.pfx'),
              passphrase: '1234'
            }
            port: 52924
          }
        })


After this, you can open https://localhost:52924 in your browser.
